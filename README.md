# ruby-whatsapp

__Still work in progress! Help needed!__

Based on the php script by @venomous0x (https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI)

I just want to transport the code in ruby to make it accessible to all the ruby-folks here.
The more people know the more whatsapp it's likely to update their shitty code.

### Tests
In order to run the specs you have to edit and rename the file _valid_credentials.yml.exmaple_ to _valid_credentials.yml_
